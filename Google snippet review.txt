-The google snippet review was designed assuming 20 languages.
-On the original website i noticed that the links were placed horizontally.
      If there were more languages to be added it would not be a pleasent experience to the user
      accessing it
- So i designed it using a dropdown whichis easy to use and understand.
- I also added a dark theme button and copy to clipboard.
- The design is compatible on smaller screens.
- There is also a search in the DropDown which will search from first letter.
